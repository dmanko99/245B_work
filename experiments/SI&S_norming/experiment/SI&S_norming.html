    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left"> In this study, we are concerned with how words are connected with social concepts. You will read sentences about DeShaun and Conner, two American males. </p>

    <p style="text-align:left"> Each frame contains one sentence about either DeShaun or Conner. Using the slider bar below the sentence, please rate how likely you think it is that the sentence is true. The slider allows you to answer on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating <i>not at all likely</i> to be true and 100 indicating <i>extremely likely</i>. 
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:left"> IMPORTANT: Occasionally you'll be asked to provide ratings for simple math problems using the slider bar. We use these as questions attention checks: for example, if the math problem is "2 + 2 = 4", your answer on the slider bar needs to be closer to <i>extremely likely</i> than to <i>not at all likely</i>. Answering these questions incorrectly can negatively affect your compensation.</p>
